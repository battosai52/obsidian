    <div class="sous-titre">BY BRODY VERCHER ON DECEMBRE 15,2014</div>
    <div class="texte3">
      <p>"The most significant feature of the emergent popular music industry of the late 1 8th and early
      1 9th centuries was the extent of its focus on the commodity form of sheet music" The availability
      of inexpensive, widely available sheet music versio Sof popular songs and instrumental music
      pieces made it possible for music to be disseminat
      a Wide audience of amateur music-
      makers, who could play and sing popular music at hòme. ln addition to the influence of shèet
      music, another factor was the increasing availability duting the late 18th and early 1 9th cen#iry
      of public popular music performances in "pleasure gardens and dance halls, popular théatres
      and concert rooms". The early popular music performers worked hand-in-hand With thesheet
      music industry to promote popular sheet music. One of the early popular music performers to
      attain widespread popularity was a Swedish opera singek Jenny Lind, who toured the US in th/
      mid-19th century. During the 1 9th century, more people began getting involved in music by
      participating in amateur choirs or joining brass bands.

    <div class="titre_news">In Every Work of Genius We Recognize Our Own Rejected Thoughts</div>
    <div class="sous-titre">BY BRODY VERCHER ON DECEMBER 12,2014</div>
    <div class="texte5"><p>I read the other day some verses written by an eminent painter which were original and not
      such lines, let the subject be what it may.
      conventional. The soul always hears an admonitio
      The sentiment they instil is of more value than any toought they may contain. To believe ypur
      own thought, to believe that what is true for You in yOurprivate heart is true for all is
      genius. Speak your latent conviction, and it shall be theuniversal sense; for the inmost iO dû'
      time becomes the outmost, and our first thought is rendered back to us by the trumpet of thé
      Last Judgment. Familiar as the voice of the mind is to each, the highest merit we ascribe go
      Moses, Plato and Milton is that they set at naught books and traditions, and spoke not what
      men, but what they thought. A man should learn to deteèt and watch that gleam of light which
      flashes across his mind from within, more than the lustre of the firmament of bards and sages,
      Yet he dismisses without notice his thought, because it is his. ln every work of genius we
      recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us With a certain alienated majesty.
      Great works of art have no more affecting lesson for thony/bio/bio.htmlus than this. They teach us to abide by our
      spontaneous impression With good- humored inflexibility then most when the whole cry of
      voices is on the other side. Else to-morrow a stranger will say With masterly good sense precisely
      what we have thought and felt all the time, and we shall be forced to take With shame our own
      opinion from another.</p>
